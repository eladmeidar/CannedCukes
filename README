h1. Canned Cukes

CannedCukes is a simple application, designed to keep track of "Cucumber":http://cuke.org features and scenarios.
CannedCukes allows users to save their features and search through other users features, maybe to find a better story/feature specs.


still to come:

* A way to *fork* a feature/scenario from another person, keeping it completely yours
* A gem to ease submission of features directly from an application root.
* for god sake a better CSS.

Patches are welcome, so as fellow committers.
